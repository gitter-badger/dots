=head1 NAME

ls++.conf - ls++ configuration file

=head1 DESCRIPTION

ls++.conf is the configuration file for ls++(1). ls++ first searches for it at
~/.config/ls++/ls++.conf then at ~/.ls++.conf then at ./ls++.conf and finally at
/etc/ls++.conf.

Lines beginning with a '#' character are comments. All other non-empty lines
are live Perl code. This gives a lot of power to the end user, but it also
allows for fuckups.

Please don't fuckup.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=over 8

=item @d

Array containting the characters to use for delimiting the columns.

=item @c

Array containing the colors to be used.

=item $colorscheme

Colorscheme to be used.

=item %ls_colors

A hash where its keys are patterns (possibly valid regular expressions) to be
matched against the files. The values should be attributes or colors which will
be added to the output.

This does the same thing as LS_COLORS, except that you can match against the
full filname, and not only the extension. Using LS_COLORS, you could never match
README or Makefile for example. Those two are matched by default.

The special value IGNORE will ignore all files matching the key pattern.

=head1 COLORS

The default colortable left here for reference (ANSI colors).
